# My personal homebrew-tap

This is the repository for some Homebrew formulae I have created.

## Installation

You can add this repository to your Homebrew taps by running the following command:

```bash
    $ brew tap merv1n34k/tap
```

After that new formulae should appear in your Homebrew, installing them can be as simple as casual `brew install`:

```bash
    $ brew install merv1n34k/tap/name_of_the_formulae
```
